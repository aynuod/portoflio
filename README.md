### 👩‍💻 About Me

Hello! I'm Dounya Gourja, a *Junior Software Engineer* passionate about *Data Science* and *Machine Learning*. I enjoy building software that makes a difference and exploring innovative ways to solve problems through technology.  

I’ve worked on a diverse set of projects, from *microservices* and *full-stack development* to *machine learning* models. My GitHub is where I document my growth and share the projects I’ve worked on—whether for internships, personal exploration, or collaborative initiatives.

I am currently pursuing my final year in *Data Science and IoT* at ENSIAS, and I’m excited to dive deeper into the world of *Software* and *Data Sciences* solutions as I build my career.
